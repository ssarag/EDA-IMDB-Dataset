3. Which movies have the highest gross?
4. Do the movies with highest IMDB rating earn highest gross always?
5. What is the trend analysis of the movie genre preferences by the audience?
6. Who are the top rated direnctors and actors?
7. What runtime is good to get a good IMDB rating and gross?
8. For a movie to be sucessful, design a plan which should include Genre, director, actors and runtime of the movie.
